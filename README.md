# searchbot-discord
**search** - a tiny little search utility bot for discord.

 _To run, rename `config-example.json` to `config.json` and add your token. If you want to add more config options, the relevant setup is found in the `init`._

 _You can find the main instance here: [https://discord.bots.gg/bots/679500597082587185](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/679500597082587185)_

 _The current version of this bot has potentially poor search results, and although it is usable, should be treated more as a proof of concept than an intended product._
 
 ## Usage:
 
 `@search help` - Find all commands.
 
 `@search rejson` - Refresh the list of SearX instances.
 
 `@search your term here` - Search for stuff.
