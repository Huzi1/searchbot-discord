# searchbot-discord

**search** - a minimalist search utility bot for discord, designed by taciturasa.

_To run, rename `config-example.json` to `config.json` and add your token. If you want to add more config options, you may do so there as well._

_Note that I will not be offering help for self-hosting. It is expected that you will have the technical know-how to do so, or that you may find support in any of the various Discord development communities._

_You can find the main instance here: [https://discord.bots.gg/bots/679500597082587185](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/679500597082587185)_
 
## Usage:
 
`@search help` - Find all commands.
